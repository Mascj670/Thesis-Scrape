# Thesis-Scrape

For my thesis I am rebuilding a search engine using a vector database RAG pipeline. Apart of this project entailed me scraping the New School Archive for past theses. 

PSA: I cannot make this code public as I have already recieved extensive pushback from the school and faculty for this project...
